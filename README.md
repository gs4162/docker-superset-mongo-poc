# Superset Mongo via Mongo BI connector test

This is a simple [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) project to demonstrate how to query a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) database with [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) through the [MongoDB BI Connector](https://docs.mongodb.com/bi-connector/v2.14/).

I would like to thanks [@smarzola](https://github.com/smarzola/) for his [sqlalchemy-mongobi](https://github.com/smarzola/sqlalchemy-mongobi) python package which adds a dialect for sqlalchemy disabling transactions not supported with the BI connector.

## Description

This docker compose project is made up of these containers :

* `poc_ssm_mongo` : a mongo 5 single instance
* `poc_ssm_mongo_express` : a mongo express UI to browse the data in the instance at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)
* `poc_ssm_mongo_bi` : a mongo bi connector connected to the mongo instance
* `poc_ssm_mongo_data` : a container loading a sample dataset in the mongo instance
* `poc_ssm_mysql_client` : a container with a mysql cli client to demonstrate connection through the mongo bi connector
* `poc_ssm_sqlalchemy` : a container with a simple sqlalchemy script to demonstrate connection through the mongo bi connector
* `poc_ssm_superset` : a container with a superset instance to demonstrate connection through the mongo bi connector

## Usage

Starts the project

```
docker-compose up
```

Wait for everything to be ready and for the `poc_ssm_mongo_data` to exit with a 0 status code.

*Note : look at the logs of the superset instance before connecting to wait for all the init scripts in the entrypoint to finish before the gunicorn web server is started*

Then you can try the different connection mode.

### 1. mysql cli client

```
$ docker-compose exec poc_ssm_mysql_client bash

# mysql -h poc_ssm_mongo_bi -P 3307 -u 'root?source=admin' --default-auth=mongosql_auth -proot

## Important

You can look at the different Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh scripts to see the details. However there are a few things I did in this POC and I want to point out. 

1. Mongo BI connector :

    1. As the database is in auth mode, the bi connector needs to be too (`--auth`) and needs to be secured with TLS `--sslMode=allowSSL` and `--sslPEMKeyFile=/path/to/an/autosigned/pem/cert/and/key`

    2. schema refresh has been enabled and is automatic but you can [build your own schema](https://docs.mongodb.com/bi-connector/v2.14/schema-configuration/)

2. Superset : 

    1. in file `/app/superset/sql_lab.py` around line `432`, there is a `conn.commit()` instruction that needs to be commented in order to be able to use the sql lab.

    2. as the mysqlclient sends the password as cleartext (over tls), you need to add the `LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN=1` environment variable
